General Note:

This solution was implemented as specified in the task description. For this solution, Codeceptjs and WebDriverIO were used together with selenium standalone
using ChromeDriver. For reporting, I used mocha-junit-reporter as a tool to generate an XML report with the test results and Allure to provide a graphical
representation of the test results.  

The implementation: 

This solution was implemented mainly in RegistrationPage_test.js. This Test Suite makes use of 2 Page Objects (HomePageObject.js and RegistrationPageObject.js) 
to define fields and methods related to these pages. With regards to test data, this test suite reads JSON files from './testData' folder. It was decided that
each test (scenario) would have its own JSON file to represent the user being created in that particular test. 

In the test class (RegistrationPage_test.js), one can find a Before method which executes before each test scenario to execute the common code for all scenarios.
Then, one can find 3 scenarios; 'Test Registration Page - Success', 'Test Registration Page - Register Duplicate User',  
'Test Registration Page - Check for Field Validations Required' and 'Test Registration Page - Check for Field Validations'. In the first scenario, I am testing
the success path - the path where all fields are valid and I assert that after registration, the application logs in with the correct user just registered and
that the personal details match those that the user registered with. In the second scenario, I am testing that the system does not allow duplicate users to
register since the username must be unique. In the third scenario, I am testing that if one tries to leave the required fields empty, the system shows that
these fields are required. In the final scenario, I am testing that if invalid data is passed to the system, the respective UI validation errors are shown. 

With regards to Page Objects, I have implemented two: HomePageObject.js and RegistrationPageObject.js (found at './pages'). In the HomePageObject, I have 
implemented 3 methods: one to go to the registration page via the pop up which is shown when one goes to the tipico website and the other two click on the 
register button and on the logout buttons in the header of webpage. In the RegistrationPageObject, I have, first of all, split the fields locators into 
sections which are like the sections of the webpage itself for maintainability, cleanliness and readability purposes. Moreover, I have implemented methods 
which fill the sections of the registration page which take a JSON object as test data and fill in the respective section of the page with this test data; 
I have split them into sections, again, for maintainability, cleanliness and readability purposes. Then, I have another method called registerUser() which 
calls all the other methods so that in the test class, one would not have to call 5 methods but only one. 

One limitation of this implementation is that since the JSON file is fixed, tests which are executed more than once will not pass since a username should be 
unique. Another way this could have been implemented would be to create a JSON file for each test on the fly with random data so that data will be unique,
implying that the test could run for as many times as many as one likes. This is a more ideal way to be implemented but I thought it would be out of scope of
this exercise to go into this level of detail/complexity. 

In case one would like to test this out using his/her own JSON file, please create a valid JSON file with extension .json in './testData' folder and use the 
file from the test scenario, referring to it by path. 

Commands used: 

-> To create the test class: codeceptjs gt
-> To create page objects: codeceptjs gpo
-> For the reporting to work (xml report): npm install -g mocha, npm install -g mocha-junit-reporter
-> For the reporting to work (allure report which uses xml report): scoop install allure after installing scoop and powershell version >= 3

To run: 

-> Start selenium server: selenium-standalone start and make sure you see 'Selenium Started'
-> To run the tests (should be run in the location where the RegistrationPage_test.js is found): codeceptjs run --reporter mocha-junit-reporter
-> To run allure report (make sure you have xml report in './output' - should have been generated by the previous step): allure serve /path/to/project/output/
